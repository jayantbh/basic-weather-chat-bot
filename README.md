# Basic Weather Bot

A super-basic weather chat bot that uses WIT.ai and Facebook APIs to work in your facebook/messenger chat.

Man, making chatbots nowadays is so easy. I know almost nothing about actual ML or AI theory otherwise.

This bot was originally built in May 2016 (over a year ago from now). I realised it wasn't on GitHub, so I removed all tokens from past commits and pushed it to github as well. (It was only on heroku earlier.)
